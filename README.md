# origin-importfilter

Add ("install") the OriginLab OriginPro import filters to your Origin installation by copying the _.oif_ files to the Filters subfolder of your origin user files folder. This is usually something like _"C:\Users\YOUR.USERNAME\Documents\OriginLab\2015\UserFiles\Filters\User Files"_. You can find more information on the Origin website http://www.originlab.de/doc/Origin-Help/UserFilesFolder.

If you have comments or questions on any of the filters or find and fix a bug, please let me know by filling an issue on github.

The import filters are licensed under _the Unlicense_ so go ahead, modify and share them. Return the favor, please.

## SQUID_RSO_ASCII.oif

This filter is intended to ease the import of M-H and M-T curves produced by a Quantum Design SQUDI magnetometer. The filter imports just the _Temperature_, _Field_ and _Long Moment_ rows from the measurement files and converts all data into SI units.

  * Tested with files generated by a _Quantum Design MPMS XL-7_ SQUID magnetometer running the _MPMS MultiVu Revision 1.60 Build 081_ software
  * Associates with __*.rso.dat__ and __*.dc.dat__ files 
  * Imports the INFO variables _Temperature_, _Name_, _Weight_, _Area_, _Length_, _Shape_ and _Comment_ from the file
  * Adds a _volume_ user parameter to the worksheet that is used to volume normalize the data
  * Converts all units into SI
  * Fixes column names and units
